># GOpanel

---

GOpanel is an online analytics panel that you can install on any Linux based server. Monitor your RAM usage with RAMonitor, check your VM Stats, view large files, and more!

GOpanel is designed in `bash` commands and executed as `CGI` scripts on the server. Due to the nature of `bash` commands and the fact that they are executing on the server, all changes must be approved before being added to the program. 

>## Releases
About every month, if there have been enough changes, a new version will most likely be released. If the changes mainly consist of bug fixes and few features, then it will be a X.X.⬆release. If there are several new features, then it will be a X.⬆ release. If it has a large amount of features, and a new UI design, it will be a ⬆.X release. If the same X.⬆ releases keep happening all the way up to X.9, all release levels will be shifted back one. I.e X.⬆ becomes X.X.⬆, X.X.⬆ becomes X.X.X.⬆. All releases will be offered for download, but only the newest one will be supported.
