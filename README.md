># GOpanel
GOpanel is an online analytics panel that you can install on any Linux based server. Monitor your RAM usage with RAMonitor, check your VM Stats, view large files, and more!

GOpanel is designed in `bash` commands and executed as `CGI` scripts on the server. Due to the nature of `bash` commands and the fact that they are executing on the server, all changes must be approved before being added to the program.
